<p><b><h3> Task 1 </h3></b></p>
<p> The correct answers are: a) 16.2 and b) 116.2, because each answer has only one digit after the dot and <= digits than 4. </p>
  
<p><b><h3> Task 2 </h3></b></p> 
<p> The maximal value of: int is = 2,147,483,647;
                          DECIMAL(2,1) = 9.9;
  If we multiply we get: 21 260 088 105,3, so we have 12 digits. Col3 should have at least DECIMAL(12,1).</p>
